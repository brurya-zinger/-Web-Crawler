# -Web-Crawler
this project Implements a web crawler in Python that browses a vendor website, downloads firmware files, and fetches their metadata
I chose to take the metadata from a column of the name in the table
and then fetch  to the info page where I took :
* Last modified
* Brand
* Model

for  check if the information in the website is changed, and update the new information in the database.
i looking  for a change from one list to another and a change the db  accordingly


I'm sure there's a more effective and beautiful way to do it
I would love if you share with me!
